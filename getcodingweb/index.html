		<h1>Hello! <br> My name is Matthew Hardy</h1>

		<p> <b>About me</b> <br> I am a classical double bassist, composer and ardent enthusiast of all things Nintendo. I am from St. Johnâ€™s Newfoundland and I enjoy playing music of all forms and genres can be found in the bass section of the symphony, jamming jazz standards downtown, or arranging some of my favourite video game tunes. I am a big fan of tabletop rpgs and love telling stories as both a player, and a DM. Despite my best efforts, my dice collection is ever-growing.
